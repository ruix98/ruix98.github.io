I am a first-year PhD student at the Université Bourgogne-Franche-Comté, working in the CIAD laboratory. My research interests lie at the intersection of quantum computing, metaheuristic algorithms, and combinatorial optimization. I am passionate about exploring innovative approaches to tackle complex computational problems and advancing the frontiers of quantum algorithm design.
